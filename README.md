# DNA_Storage

## A DNA-Based Archival Storage System
In this project, we will presents an architecture for a DNA-based archival storage system. It is structured as a key-value store, and leverages common biochemical techniques to provide random access. We also propose a new encoding scheme that offers controllable redundancy, trading off reliability for density.
